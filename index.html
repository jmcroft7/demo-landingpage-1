            <h2>Elden Ring?</h2>
            <p>In the Lands Between ruled by Queen Marika the Eternal, the Elden Ring, the source of the Erdtree, has
                been shattered.
                
                Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring known as the Great Runes, and the
                mad taint of their newfound strength triggered a war: The Shattering. A war that meant abandonment by
                the Greater Will.
                
                And now the guidance of grace will be brought to the Tarnished who were spurned by the grace of gold and
                exiled from the Lands Between. Ye dead who yet live, your grace long lost, follow the path to the Lands
                Between beyond the foggy sea to stand before the Elden Ring.</p>
